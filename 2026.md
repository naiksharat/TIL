## 1/1/2026 - Reframing & the Inverse Perspective

Say you want to bump your success rate from 99% to 99.9%.

**The optimistic take:**
99.9% - 99% = 0.9% increase. Barely anything, right? Should be a piece of cake.

**The reality check (inverse perspective):**
- 99% success = 1% failure
- 99.9% success = 0.1% failure

Going from 1% to 0.1% failure? That's a **10x improvement**. From 1% to 0.01%? A **100x improvement**.

Turns out these "tiny" gains are brutally hard to achieve. They cost a ton and take forever.

This is basically the **80/20 rule** in action. You can nail 80% of something with just 20% of the effort. But squeezing out that last 20%? Yeah, that'll take the other 80% of your time.
