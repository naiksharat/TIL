## 27/12/2025 - Netflix UHD Streaming

I can't stream UHD content on Google Chrome on Apple & Windows thanks to the **Widevine L3 DRM**. Switch to Safari on Apple (_FairPlay DRM_) & Edge on Windows (_PlayReady DRM_).

## 28/12/2025 - Golang's Memory Model

**Stack** (grows downwards)
- Per go routine
- Scope limited to a function. Once a function exits, all vars in its scope go with it
- Stack overflow is extremely rare in Go

**Heap** (grows upwards)
- Shared by all goroutines
- Heaps are garbage collected

**Global scope**
- Shared across goroutines
- `.data`: initialized global vars, `var x = 42`
- `.bss`: zero init global vars, `var x int`

**Code segment**
- Shared across goroutines

`const` are replaced with their values during compile time. So they don't live in the standard memory model of Go. Can't get a pointer.

Vars limited to a function live in the stack. Vars that escape a function (via pointers/references and closures - escape analysis) are allocated on the heap. Vars that are global/at the package level live in the global scope.
