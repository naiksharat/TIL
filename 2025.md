## 27/12/2025 - Netflix UHD Streaming

I can't stream UHD content on Google Chrome on Apple & Windows thanks to the **Widevine L3 DRM**. Switch to Safari on Apple (_FairPlay DRM_) & Edge on Windows (_PlayReady DRM_).

## 28/12/2025 - Golang's Memory Model

**Stack** (grows downwards)
- Per go routine
- Scope limited to a function. Once a function exits, all vars in its scope go with it
- Stack overflow is extremely rare in Go

**Heap** (grows upwards)
- Shared by all goroutines
- Heaps are garbage collected

**Global scope**
- Shared across goroutines
- `.data`: initialized global vars, `var x = 42`
- `.bss`: zero init global vars, `var x int`

**Code segment**
- Shared across goroutines

`const` are replaced with their values during compile time. So they don't live in the standard memory model of Go. Can't get a pointer.

Vars limited to a function live in the stack. Vars that escape a function (via pointers/references and closures - escape analysis) are allocated on the heap. Vars that are global/at the package level live in the global scope.

## 31/12/2025 - Locality of Behavior

https://htmx.org/essays/locality-of-behaviour/

“The primary feature for easy maintenance is locality: Locality is that characteristic of source code that enables a programmer to understand that source by looking at only a small portion of it.” – Richard Gabriel

Locality of Behaviour is the principle that: The behaviour of a unit of code should be as obvious as possible by looking only at that unit of code

LoB is a subjective software design principle that can help make a code base more humane and maintainable. It must be traded off against other design principles (DRY and Separation of Concerns) and be considered in terms of the limitations of the system a code unit is written in, but, as much as is it is practical, adherence to this principle will increase your software maintainability, quality and sustainability.

## 1/1/2026 - Reframing & the Inverse Perspective

Say you want to bump your success rate from 99% to 99.9%.

**The optimistic take:**
99.9% - 99% = 0.9% increase. Barely anything, right? Should be a piece of cake.

**The reality check (inverse perspective):**
- 99% success = 1% failure
- 99.9% success = 0.1% failure

Going from 1% to 0.1% failure? That's a **10x improvement**. From 1% to 0.01%? A **100x improvement**.

Turns out these "tiny" gains are brutally hard to achieve. They cost a ton and take forever.

This is basically the **80/20 rule** in action. You can nail 80% of something with just 20% of the effort. But squeezing out that last 20%? Yeah, that'll take the other 80% of your time.
